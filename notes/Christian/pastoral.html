          <p>
            As you all know, the Apostle Paul wrote a collection of letters now
            included in the New Testament, ranging from theological treatises to
            personal correspondence, which have significantly influenced
            Christian doctrine and practice. Out of all the letters attributed
            to Paul in the New Testament, skeptical critics like Bart Ehrman
            recognize only seven as genuinely his (Romans, 1 & 2 Corinthians,
            Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, and Philemon). This
            presents a dilemma for Christians: either discard six books of their
            Bible or admit that the New Testament includes some well-intentioned
            forgeries.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some New Testament scholars, like Bart Ehrman, argue that six of
            these letters are blatant forgeries, most notably 1 and 2 Timothy,
            which I'll be arguing against in this article. If we were to believe
            these scholars, it could put the Christian faith at great risk. In
            this short article, I'll be trying my best to argue FOR Pauline
            authorship. If the critics' arguments turn out to be weak, then it’s
            not the New Testament that loses credibility but its detractors.
          </p>

          <h1>Bart Ehrman's Main Arguments</h1>
          <p>
            In Ehrman's book, "Forged: Writing in the Name of God – Why the
            Bible's Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are," he lays out three
            main arguments as to why the Pastoral Epistles are forgeries. While
            there are more than three arguments, he clearly presents three as
            his main points.
          </p>

          <h1>Vocabulary Issues</h1>
          <p>
            Bart Ehrman’s first and arguably weakest point centers on vocabulary
            issues. This is a rather popular argument used by skeptics but is
            weak. Ehrman presents the argument the following way <br />
            <br />
            “There are 848 different words used in the pastoral letters. Of that
            number 306-over one-third of them!-do not occur in any of the other
            Pauline letters of the New Testament. That’s an inordinately high
            number; especially given the fact that about two-thirds of these 306
            words are used by Christian authors living in the second century.
            This suggests the author is using a vocabulary that was becoming
            more common after the days of Paul, and that he too, therefore,
            lived after Paul.” — Forged: Writing In The Name Of God – Why The
            Bible’s Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are. Pg 112
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're not entirely convinced by this line of reasoning, I
            wholeheartly agree . We all have a tendency to adjust our linguistic
            repertoire based on the specific individuals we're conversing with.
            For instance, everyone reading this uses a different set of
            vocabulary when talking to different audiences. The Pastoral letters
            were Paul's personal letters directed to Timothy, his spiritual son.
            Of course, these will sound different compared to letters written to
            whole congregations of Christians. It's not difficult to discern the
            rationale behind the variation in his choice of words.

            <br />
            <br />
            Ehrman even states that this isn't a strong argument oposing Pauline
            authorship. Quoting Bart: “Probably not too much stock should be
            placed in mere numbers. Everyone, after all, uses different words on
            different occasions, and most of us have a much richer stock of
            vocabulary than shows up in any given set of letters we write.”

            <br />
            <br />
            Let's use a real life example to illustrate my rebutal of this point
            further. When you are talking to a co-worker you have known for
            years and years, you talk a certain way. But when writing an e-mail
            to address to whole company you obviously will use different
            language then when talking to a co-worker. I really don't think this
            argument is all that to strong, since differing vocabulary when
            talking to different people/groups is a well researched and common
            phenomenon.
          </p>

          <h1>The meaning of the word "Faith" in the Pastoral epistles</h1>
          <p>
            This is in my opinion Bart's biggest mistake in his takedown of the
            Pastoral Epistles. Here he just makes obvious Biblical mistakes. And
            I don't blame Bart for making these mistakes, but I find it sad that
            these arguments are just so widely accepted by the whole community
            of Biblical critics just because Bart came up with them, instead of
            digging deeper.
          </p>
          <p>
            This argument from Bart is about the word "Faith", which is "pistes"
            in greek. The argument from Bart here isn't that faith is worthless
            and just a lack of evidence[1], which a lot of critics attribute to
            the word faith, but rather that the word is used in different ways
            in the Pastorals compared to the other books.
          </p>
          <p>
            “In books such as Romans and Galatians faith refers to the trust a
            person has in Christ to bring about salvation through his death. In
            other words, the term describes a relationship with another; faith
            is a trust “in” Christ. The author of the Pastorals also uses the
            term “faith.” But here it is not about a relationship with Christ;
            faith now means the body of teaching that makes up the Christian
            religion. That is “the faith” (see Titus 1:13) Same word, different
            meaning.” –Forged, pp. 113
          </p>
          <p>
            But hang on a second! That just isn’t true. Paul mostly does use the
            word ‘faith’ in the manner that Bart says, but he also does use it
            to refer to a body of doctrine at times in his undisputed letters.
            Here are some examples: <br />
            <br />
            1 Corinthians 16:13 (ESV) “Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act
            like men, be strong.” <br /><br />2 Cor 13:5 “Examine yourselves, to
            see whether you are in the faith… <br /><br />Gal 1:23 “They only
            were hearing it said, “He who used to persecute us is now preaching
            the faith he once tried to destroy.” <br /><br />Phil 1:27 “Only let
            your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that
            whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you
            are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side
            for the faith of the gospel”<br /><br />
            Ehrman’s just wrong here to suggest that Paul doesn’t use different
            shades of meaning when he’s using the word ‘faith’. He doesn’t use
            it in a wooden manner that has only one definition.

          <h2>A Counter Argument: Polycarp and other early church fathers</h2>
          <p>
            If there was anyone in a position to know who wrote 1st and 2nd
            Timothy, it would have been the church father Polycarp. In his
            letter to the Philippian church written in about 110-120 AD,
            Polycarp quoted 1 Timothy 3:8, 6:7, 6:10 and 2 Timothy 2:12. He also
            mentions Paul by name four times in his letter, including some
            indications that he was familiar with the apostle’s martyrdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an article from a Biblical Scholar
            <a
              href="https://www.biola.edu/blogs/good-book-blog/2012/polycarp-of-smyrna-tells-us-who-he-thinks-wrote-1-2-timothy-apostolic-fathers-4"
              >Kenneth Berding.</a
            >
            He he makes 2 big observations about Polycarp's usage of 1st and 2th
            Timothy.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the sake of not bloating this article to much I won't be
            presenting the quotes from
            <a
              href="https://www.biola.edu/blogs/good-book-blog/2012/polycarp-of-smyrna-tells-us-who-he-thinks-wrote-1-2-timothy-apostolic-fathers-4"
              >Kenneth Berding's article</a
            >
            here, but please read them if you are interested.
            <br />
            The implication of the first observation is that Polycarp considers
            the phrases in each cluster to be Pauline. The implication of the
            second observation is that Polycarp considers the phrases which he
            quotes from 1 and 2 Timothy also to be from Paul.
            <br />
            This, of course, doesn’t prove that Polycarp is correct in his
            assessment. But… "Polycarp was doubtlessly the most significant
            ecclesiastical leader of the first half of II C. E.”
          </p>
          <p>
            And around 40-50 years later, Irenaeus clearly attributes the
            Pastoral Letters to Paul. In his text Against Heresies, Irenaeus
            discusses heretics and quotes Paul's instruction to "avoid" after
            repeated warnings (Titus 3:10). Additionally, Irenaeus references
            Paul's advice to steer clear of individuals promoting "novelties of
            words of false knowledge" (1 Tim 6:20).
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the Didache's author, an early Christian writer from the
            late 1st century, directly references 1 Timothy 3:4. Additionally,
            the Pastoral Letters are cited by Clement of Alexandria (180 AD),
            Tertullian (220 AD), and Origen (230 AD). The early church's
            testimony is unequivocal: they regarded the Pastorals as
            authoritative and believed them to be genuinely penned by the
            Apostle Paul.
          </p>
          <h2>Main takeaways</h2>
          <p>
            In summary, the external evidence supporting both of these letters
            is robust, as is the internal evidence. Upon scrutiny, Bart's
            assertions about conflicting theologies in Paul's other letters
            appear unsubstantiated. There are compelling grounds to believe that
            Paul authored all the letters attributed to him by the early church,
            with insufficient evidence to suggest they are forgeries. Our New
            Testament includes 13 authentic letters from Paul.
          </p>

          <small
            >Note [1], Not even one Biblical Greek scholar would ever agree that
            that is the meaning of the word pistes. And asserting that faith is
            just believe without evidence is characteristcally false.</small
