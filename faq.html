      <b>Studying:</b><br />
      How do I study better? Practice, like any skill, you need to hone it and
      develop it over a period of time. And that involves a lot of studying and
      working. Don't push yourself too hard, otherwise, you will get burnt out.
      You need to strike the balance between pushing yourself hard enough to get
      peak improvement and not working too hard. Thank you!
