            ps, this is a rather old article I never intended to publish, but
            now I'm releasing it.
          </p>

            It would be impossible to live our lives without trust. All of us
            put our trust in something or someone, and of course, there are some
            people, sadly, who find it very difficult to trust other people. But
            it's very easy for us to convince ourselves that we trust God. Very
            easy because we can have thoughts about God. The idea of God can be
            comforting and can be something of a crutch in our lives. We have
            very strong feelings about God, but strong feelings are not the same
            as trusting in God.
          </p>
          <p>
            We discover how much we truly trust God when things go wrong, when
            we suffer, when we are touched by the chaos of losing control. And
            we discover really how much we trust in ourselves, our own sense of
            control of life. So, God will sometimes allow us these moments of
            suffering to bring us to our senses because to trust God, we must
            recognize that our whole lives are in His hands, that we are not in
            control. Our whole lives, even those moments of pain, fear, real
            suffering, because we are called to carry our cross. Without the
            cross, there can be no resurrection, there can be no salvation.
          </p>

            This is why Christ, in the Beatitudes, says, "Blessed are those who
            mourn," No, not the rich people who lose a few million euros and
            perhaps mourn over their financial loss, but those who mourn for
            their sins. As the psalmist David said, shedding tears from the very
            morning, from the beginning of the day, grieving over his sins. We
            are called to repent, to be released from what shackles us. We
            remember the paralytic who was lowered to be healed by Christ, and
            Christ forgave him his sins. His paralysis brought him to Christ,
            and he was able to find salvation. So, we may be paralyzed by our
            sins, by our passions. We must shake them off. Christ's instruction
            to that man was, "Take up your bed and walk." He calls us to be
            active, take up our bed and walk, to repent, to do something, not to
            lie in our bed and fester in our sin.
          </p>
          <p>
            We remember that two men died beside Christ. One continued to curse
            and abuse Christ while the other recognized the justice of his own
            suffering. He recognized his own sin. We remember both men died on
            the cross, both men, but Christ promised the one that that very day
            he would be in paradise with Christ. In recognizing his sin and
            repenting, he still had to die on the cross. We must not be led
            astray by false heretical versions of Christianity which promise the
            superficial instant fix. It is a process, a painful process, a
            process of self-reflection, a process of taking up a cross, of
            recognizing a sin, of mourning inwardly over the passions that we
            have allowed to develop their warning. Accepting the forgiveness of
            God, the healing of God, the change that He brings to us so that our
            mourning may become joy.
