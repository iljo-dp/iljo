    <title>Minimalism, and why I'm one</title>

<h2>Minimalism</h2>
<br>
<h3>introduction</h3>
It's not hard to notice the amount of people who are addicted to their phones nowadays.<br>
It seems like most people are and it's not necessary that they're addicted to their phones but more to the apps on the phone.<br>
<li>
    <ul>Social media</ul>
    <ul>Online shopping</ul>
    <ul>Streaming services</ul>
    <ul>Video games</ul>
    <ul>Online pornography</ul>
</li>
<br>
Al of these very addictive things that we have content constant access to. <br>
and this has a variety of negative effects of course, for example mental health and the ability to focus. <br>
And I find the pretty scary, and I think it's important to be aware of these things and to be aware of how they affect us <br>
But yeah I'm a specialist, I've been addicted to some of those things in some capacity at some point in my life(not all) <br>
But I'm glad that I've know grown past that and have learned to be more prudent about my technology and to abstain from sin <br>

<h2>Embracing minimalism</h2>
In the fast-paced, technology-driven world we live in today, it's crucial to recognize the impact of our digital habits on our <br> 
Acknowledging the addictive nature of these online experiences is the first step toward finding a healthier balance. <br>
We should note that the problem isn't the technology itself, but rather the way we use it, and that everyone before us has lived wihtout it. <br>
<br>
Minimalism is a lifestyle and mindset that encourages simplifying our lives by consciously reducing the clutter, distractions, and excess in various areas, including our use of technology. <br>
It's about focusing on what truly matters and finding more meaningful experiences outside of the digital realm.
And realising 
<br>
think that initially drew me to minimalism was the fact that I was very addicted to my cell phone and I was also a really poor student<br>
I didn't necessarily want to be a better student actually but I wanted to be less reliant on my phone I just thought it was kind of lame how many people were glued to it all the time
<br>
But by embracing minimalism, I was able to improve my grades and my overall well-being by cutting out every distractions in my life, allowing me to focus on what is actually important.
<br>


<h2>Minimalism and the Bible</h2>
The Bible has a lot to say about minimalism, and it's a very important topic in the Bible. <br>
<br>
Jesus teaches us that we should not be attached to the things of this world, but that we must strive for heaven and not the eartly pleasures <br>
<br>
