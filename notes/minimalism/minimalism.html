    <h2>Minimalism</h2>
    <br />
    <h3>introduction</h3>
    It's not hard to notice the amount of people who are addicted to their
    phones nowadays.<br />
    It seems like most people are and it's not necessary that they're addicted
    to their phones but more to the apps on the phone.<br />
    <li>
      <ul>
        Social media
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Online shopping
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Streaming services
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Video games
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Online pornography
      </ul>
    </li>
    <br />
    Al of these very addictive things that we have content constant access to.
    <br />
    and this has a variety of negative effects of course, for example mental
    health and the ability to focus. <br />
    And I find the pretty scary, and I think it's important to be aware of these
    things and to be aware of how they affect us <br />
    But yeah I'm a specialist, I've been addicted to some of those things in
    some capacity at some point in my life(not all) <br />
    But I'm glad that I've know grown past that and have learned to be more
    prudent about my technology and to abstain from sin <br />

    <h2>Embracing minimalism</h2>
    In the fast-paced, technology-driven world we live in today, it's crucial to
    recognize the impact of our digital habits on our <br />
    Acknowledging the addictive nature of these online experiences is the first
    step toward finding a healthier balance.
    <br />
    We should note that the problem isn't the technology itself, but rather the
    way we use it, and that everyone before us has lived wihtout it. <br />
    <br />
    Minimalism is a lifestyle and mindset that encourages simplifying our lives
    by consciously reducing the clutter, distractions, and excess in various
    areas, including our use of technology. <br />
    It's about focusing on what truly matters and finding more meaningful
    experiences outside of the digital realm. And realising
    <br />
    think that initially drew me to minimalism was the fact that I was very
    addicted to my cell phone and I was also a really poor student<br />
    I didn't necessarily want to be a better student actually but I wanted to be
    less reliant on my phone I just thought it was kind of lame how many people
    were glued to it all the time
    <br />
    But by embracing minimalism, I was able to improve my grades and my overall
    well-being by cutting out every distractions in my life, allowing me to
    focus on what is actually important.
    <br />

    <h2>Minimalism and the Bible</h2>
    The Bible has a lot to say about minimalism, and it's a very important topic
    in the Bible. <br />
    <br />
    Minimalism, a contemporary movement rooted in simplicity, finds its timeless
    wisdom in the Bible.
    <br />
    In Matthew 6:19-21, Jesus advises us to focus on heavenly treasures over
    earthly possessions, emphasizing the pursuit of lasting value.
    <br />
    The story of the "Widow's Mite" in Mark 12:41-44 highlights the significance
    of intention over extravagance.
    <br />
    The Bible's teachings align with minimalist principles. They encourage us to
    declutter our lives from material distractions and prioritize what truly
    matters.
    <br />
    By following these teachings, we can discover depth in simplicity, embracing
    an intentional, purpose-driven existence.
