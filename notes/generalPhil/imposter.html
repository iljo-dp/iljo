        <h1>The Myth of Impostor Syndrome: Stop Lying to Yourself</h1>
        <p>Let’s get one thing straight: most of you whining about “impostor syndrome” don’t actually have impostor
          syndrome. Sure, the <em>real</em> thing exists—a genuine psychological phenomenon—but that’s not what 99% of
          the internet is talking about.</p>
        <p>What we’re actually dealing with here is a collective refusal to face reality. You feel like you don’t know
          what you’re doing at your job? That’s not a syndrome—that’s just the cold, hard truth. Most people are bad at
          their jobs. They bumble through tasks, barely scrape by, and then slap a mental health label on their
          incompetence to make it sound like some external force is holding them back.</p>
        <p>It’s not. You’re bad at your job because you lack the skills, knowledge, or discipline to do it well. That
          nagging voice in your head telling you you’re screwing up? That’s not some sinister brain chemistry sabotaging
          your confidence—that’s reality tapping you on the shoulder. Listen to it.</p>
        <p>Here’s the brutal part: pretending your failures are just a “confidence issue” is a cop-out. If you think the
          problem is in your head and not in your actions, you’ll never fix it. Stop dodging accountability. If you
          suck, then admit it—and do something about it. Learn. Practice. Get better.</p>
        <p>Your so-called “impostor syndrome” isn’t a diagnosis. It’s your conscience, screaming at you to pay
          attention. The sooner you embrace that, the sooner you can grow. Because you <strong>can</strong> get better.
          You <strong>can</strong> learn. You <strong>can</strong> succeed. But only if you stop lying to yourself.</p>
